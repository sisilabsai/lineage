# Ontological Freeze Declaration

**Status**: RATIFIED  
**Date**: 2026-01-22

---

## Immutable Foundations

The following ontological primitives are complete and frozen:

1. **Identity** — Unique, irreversible, non-clonable
2. **Memory** — Append-only causal chain, terminable
3. **Metabolism** — Finite energy, monotonically decreasing
4. **Scars** — Permanent consequences, immutable severity
5. **Death** — Final state, irreversible
6. **Error Severity** — Immutable after creation

---

## Irreversibility Mandate

No future modification, extension, or contribution may:

- Weaken irreversibility of any primitive
- Introduce bypass, override, or escape mechanisms
- Enable state restoration, rollback, or replay
- Allow consequence reversal or modification
- Permit identity duplication or recreation

---

## Extension Constraints

Extensions to this system:

- **MUST** be compositional (built atop primitives)
- **MUST NOT** alter foundational semantics
- **MUST** preserve all existing invariants
- **MUST NOT** introduce configuration options weakening constraints

---

## Forbidden Operations

The following operations are permanently forbidden:

- Reset, rollback, or undo of state
- Replay, time travel, or history rewriting
- Recovery, healing, or scar removal
- Resurrection, revival, or death bypass
- Identity cloning, copying, or recreation
- Energy restoration, recharge, or addition
- Scar modification, deletion, or severity downgrade
- Memory erasure, clearing, or unsealing
- Error severity mutation after creation

---

## Enforcement

Contributions violating this declaration:

- **MUST** be rejected during code review
- **MUST NOT** be merged to canonical repository
- **MUST** be classified as ontological corruption

---

## Versioning Policy

### Version Structure

This system uses `ONTOLOGY.CAPABILITY.FIX` versioning:

- **ONTOLOGY** — Frozen at 1. Increment = new system, not evolution.
- **CAPABILITY** — Compositional extensions atop primitives.
- **FIX** — Bug corrections preserving invariants.

### Ontological Break

An ontological break occurs when:

- Any primitive is weakened or bypassed
- Irreversibility is compromised
- Forbidden operations become possible
- Invariants can be violated

**Ontological breaks are system death, not version 2.0.**

### Allowed Changes

**CAPABILITY (1.X.0) releases may:**

- Add new behavior types (compositional)
- Add inspection methods (read-only)
- Add serialization formats
- Extend error contexts (additive only)
- Add derived metrics from existing state

**CAPABILITY releases MUST NOT:**

- Modify existing primitives
- Remove restrictions
- Add mutating operations to frozen types
- Introduce configuration weakening constraints

**FIX (1.X.Y) releases may:**

- Correct runtime checks
- Fix documentation inaccuracies
- Repair panic messages
- Improve error diagnostics (without changing severity)

**FIX releases MUST NOT:**

- Change public API contracts
- Alter invariant enforcement
- Modify energy costs
- Change scar severity calculations

### Rejected Semver Conventions

Conventional semantic versioning is rejected where:

- Breaking changes = major bump
  - **REJECTED**: Ontological breaks are not versioned.
- New features = minor bump
  - **MODIFIED**: Only compositional features allowed.
- Bug fixes = patch bump
  - **ACCEPTED**: If invariants preserved.

### Incompatible Evolution

If ontological primitives require modification:

1. Current system is declared **COMPLETE**
2. Development ceases on 1.X branch
3. New system receives new name
4. No migration path is provided

This is not abandonment. This is finality.

## License Integrity Addendum

### Permitted Use

This software may be:

- Studied without restriction
- Modified for experimentation
- Extended with compositional features
- Forked for derivative works
- Used in any context

### Compatibility Protection

Derivative works that weaken, bypass, or remove irreversible constraints:

- **MUST NOT** claim compatibility with this system
- **MUST NOT** use the name "Lineage" in package identifiers
- **MUST NOT** represent themselves as conforming implementations

### Prohibited Misrepresentation

The following constitute misrepresentation:

- Claiming "Lineage-compatible" when ontological primitives are altered
- Advertising "based on Lineage" when irreversibility is optional
- Distributing modified versions with weakened constraints under original name
- Representing variants with bypass mechanisms as conforming implementations

### Allowed Derivatives

Derivatives that preserve all ontological constraints:

- **MAY** claim compatibility
- **MAY** reference this system
- **MAY** use "Lineage" in documentation
- **MUST** maintain all invariants from frozen primitives

### Explicit Non-Compliance

Derivatives that modify ontological primitives:

- **MUST** use distinct names
- **MUST** disclose non-conformance prominently
- **MUST NOT** imply endorsement or compatibility

### Enforcement Scope

This addendum protects:

- Ontological integrity claims
- System identity and naming
- Technical compatibility assertions

This addendum does NOT restrict:

- Usage contexts or domains
- License terms of derivatives
- Commercial or non-commercial use
- Criticism or analysis

## Finality

This declaration is final.

The ontology is frozen.

No appeals.
