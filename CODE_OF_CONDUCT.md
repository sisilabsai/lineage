# Code of Conduct

## Our Covenant

We are building a community around consequential software architecture.

This covenant establishes how we treat each other while doing this work.

---

## Our Principles

### 1. Intellectual Honesty

We engage with ideas rigorously.

- **Intellectual rigor required**: Arguments about code, architecture, and design must be technically grounded
- **Bad faith rejected**: Ad hominem, appeals to emotion, and reputational arguments are not welcome
- **Disagreement welcomed**: Strong disagreement about technical direction is healthy and expected
- **Clarity demanded**: Unclear or vague criticism will be asked to be made specific

We are not here to be nice. We are here to be clear.

### 2. Respect Through Standards

We respect each other through shared standards.

- **Code standards**: All code must meet the documented standards, regardless of author
- **Documentation standards**: All documentation must be clear and normative
- **Testing standards**: All changes must be thoroughly tested
- **Principle adherence**: All contributions must respect ontological constraints

This is not elitism. This is mutual respect through clarity.

### 3. Accountability

We hold each other accountable to the project's principles.

- **PRs can be rejected** on technical or ontological grounds—this is normal
- **Rejection is not personal**—it means the code or principle does not align with the project
- **Appeals are possible**—if you believe a rejection is incorrect, argue the case
- **Final decision rests with maintainers**—but only after clear reasoning is given

Accountability is respect. Accountability means we take your work seriously enough to critique it.

### 4. Participation Standards

Participation in this project requires:

- **Reading the documentation** before proposing changes
- **Understanding the principles** before suggesting exceptions
- **Accepting rejection** without resentment or recrimination
- **No tolerance for bad faith** arguments, personal attacks, or dismissive behavior

---

## Unacceptable Behavior

The following will result in immediate removal from the project:

### Intellectual Bad Faith

- Bad faith arguments (strawmanning, moving goalposts, pretending not to understand clear explanations)
- Reputational attacks ("you're just a zealot", "you don't understand software")
- Appeals to emotion instead of technical argument ("this will hurt adoption")
- Dismissal of documented principles without engagement with the actual reasoning

### Disrespect for Standards

- Refusing to follow code standards or testing requirements
- Submitting deliberately low-quality PRs expecting maintainers to fix them
- Ignoring documented constraints and asking for exceptions anyway
- Treating the code of conduct itself as negotiable

### Personal Attacks

- Attacks on character ("you're rigid", "you're extremist")
- Attacks on intelligence ("you don't understand X")
- Attacks on motivation ("you just want control")
- Harassment of any kind

The content of what you say matters. The tone of how you say it matters too.

We expect disagreement to be technical, specific, and respectful.

---

## Reporting Issues

If someone violates this code of conduct:

1. **Document the behavior** - capture the exchange if possible
2. **Report to maintainers** - open an issue or email directly
3. **Provide context** - explain why the behavior was problematic
4. **Do not escalate publicly** - handle reports privately first

Reports are taken seriously and investigated.

---

## Conflict Resolution

Disagreements about technical direction will be resolved by:

1. **Clear articulation** of both positions
2. **Technical discussion** grounded in principles and facts
3. **Decision by maintainers** - final authority on project direction
4. **Acceptance** of the decision - if you cannot accept it, you are not obligated to stay

If you disagree fundamentally with the project's direction, you are free to fork it.

Forks are how communities make choices. That is healthy.

---

## What This Means

### We Do Not

- Expect friendliness or small talk
- Optimize for your comfort
- Treat disagreement as conflict
- Hide criticism in politeness
- Accept convenience over principle
- Make exceptions to standards
- Debate whether constraints should exist

### We Do

- Expect professionalism and intellectual honesty
- Hold high standards for all contributors
- Value technical disagreement
- Critique ideas directly
- Hold the line on principles
- Make decisions transparently
- Explain our reasoning when asked

---

## The Bottom Line

This is a serious project.

We are building toward a fundamentally different approach to software architecture.

We are not here to be popular. We are here to be right.

This requires:
- Clarity of purpose
- Integrity of principle
- Intellectual rigor
- Mutual respect

Participation in this project means accepting these requirements.

If you do, we welcome your contribution.

If you cannot, this is not your project.

---

## For Maintainers

When enforcing this code of conduct:

1. **Be explicit** - clearly explain why behavior is problematic
2. **Give one warning** - for first violations that aren't egregious
3. **Be consistent** - apply standards equally to everyone
4. **Document decisions** - so the community understands the standard
5. **Explain reasoning** - never act arbitrarily

Enforcement is about protecting the project's integrity, not exercising power.

Use that authority carefully.

---

## A Closing Word

We are building something difficult.

Difficult things require:
- Clear principles
- High standards
- Mutual respect
- Intellectual rigor

We believe you can meet these standards.

We believe you want to build something serious.

We believe you will hold us accountable the same way we hold you.

That is the covenant.

Welcome.
