## 🎯 What Has Been Planned

### Core Vision: "Darwinian DeFi"
- Self-evolving AI agents that learn from markets
- Neural networks damaged by losses (scars)
- Evolutionary inheritance through spawning
- Cryptographically accountable decisions
- Live market data integration
- Append-only ledger of all trades

### Technical Architecture

- **Training**: Q-learning with experience replay
- **Evolution**: Gaussian mutation + crossover
- **Damage**: Scars increase exploration & reduce weights
- **Integration**: Hooks into FinanceAgent lifecycle
- **Data**: CoinMarketCap/CoinGecko providers

### Implementation Timeline
- **Phase 1 (This Week)**: Environment setup (2-3 hours)
- **Phase 2-3 (Week 2-3)**: Core ML models (4-6 days)
- **Phase 4-5 (Week 4)**: Evolution mechanics (4 days)
- **Phase 6-7 (Week 5)**: Arena integration (4 days)
