# Community Governance

## Overview

Lineage is a serious project with clear community standards. These documents establish how we work together.

---

## Key Documents

### [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)
**Our covenant with the community**

Establishes how we treat each other:
- Intellectual honesty and rigor (disagreement is welcome, bad faith is not)
- Respect through high standards (code quality, documentation, testing)
- Accountability to principles (features serve ontology, not convenience)
- Participation requirements (read docs, understand principles, accept rejection)

**What this means**: This is not a social project. This is a technical project. Disagreement is healthy, but it must be rigorous, not emotional.

---

### [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)
**How to contribute**

Opens with an explicit invitation to serious collaborators:
- Welcomes those who believe consequence matters
- Explains Lineage is a "manifesto in code"
- Requires reading MANIFESTO.md and DOCTRINE.md before contributing
- Clear about irreversibility as foundational constraint
- Details contribution standards and pull request process

**What this means**: If you believe consequence is optional, this project is not for you. If you believe consequence is essential, read on.

---

## The Message

These documents together signal three things to the world:

1. **This is serious**: We have explicit principles. We maintain high standards. We hold the line.
2. **We're hiring**: We're looking for collaborators who believe in the same things we do.
3. **We're uncompromising**: We won't add Clone to core types. We won't restore energy. We won't compromise the principles.

---

## Design Principles

Both documents follow these design principles:

### Intellectual Honesty
- No sugar-coating harsh truths
- No pretending this is "friendly"
- Clear about what we expect
- Direct about what we reject

### Inclusivity Through Clarity
- Clear about who this is for
- Clear about who should go elsewhere
- No false advertising
- No surprises after joining

### Respect Through Standards
- High standards = respect for contributors
- Clear rejection criteria = respect for time
- Technical rigor = respect for ideas
- Transparent decisions = respect for community

---

## For Potential Contributors

If you're considering contributing:

**You should join if:**
- You believe consequence should be permanent
- You believe history should be immutable  
- You believe standards are important
- You can handle rigorous technical criticism
- You want to build something that lasts

**You should go elsewhere if:**
- You want a "friendly" community with no standards
- You want your ideas to be accepted automatically
- You think "we could make an exception to the constraints"
- You interpret disagreement as personal attack
- You want adoption metrics over principles

---

## Governance in Action

### Rejection Criteria
Pull requests can be rejected for:
- Violating ontological constraints (Clone, Copy on core types, energy restoration, etc.)
- Insufficient testing or documentation
- Disagreement about architectural direction
- Not reading/understanding the manifesto

This is not personal. This is protection of the project's integrity.

### Appeal Process
If rejected:
1. You can request explicit reasoning
2. You can argue why the rejection is incorrect
3. Maintainers make final decision
4. You can fork the project (forks are healthy)

### Enforcement
Violations of the CODE_OF_CONDUCT result in:
1. **First violation** (non-egregious): One warning with explanation
2. **Repeated violations or egregious behavior**: Removal from project

Enforcement is about protecting project integrity, not exercising power.

---

## What This Costs

This level of clarity and standards has costs:

- **Fewer contributors** (only serious ones)
- **Slower growth** (no viral adoption)
- **Fewer pull requests** (only considered ones)
- **More rejections** (by design)

We accept these costs because integrity is more important than numbers.

---

## What This Gains

The benefits are worth the costs:

- **Deep collaboration** from aligned people
- **No compromises** on core principles
- **Stable direction** that doesn't shift for adoption
- **High quality** code that's reviewed rigorously
- **Clear future** where principles are protected

---

## Expanding This Community

As we grow, we need:

1. **More documentation**: explaining *why* the constraints exist
2. **Example projects**: showing what Lineage makes possible
3. **Research**: investigating consequential systems
4. **Integration patterns**: connecting Lineage to other systems
5. **Educational content**: teaching consequential thinking

**Contributors should emerge from:**
- Users of the system who understand its philosophy
- Researchers interested in consequential architecture
- Teams building systems that need permanent records
- Communities wanting to move beyond reversible state

---

## In Closing

We are not building a framework for everyone.

We are building a framework **for serious people building serious systems**.

If that's you, welcome.
