# Lineage: Public Release

**Date**: 2026-01-22

---

Software systems typically permit reset, rollback, and recovery. Actions can be undone. Resources can be restored. Errors can be caught and dismissed. Death can be avoided.

**Lineage** removes these capabilities.

---

## What This Is

A reference implementation in Rust demonstrating that software can enforce:

- Irreversible identity (cannot be cloned)
- Immutable history (cannot be erased)
- Finite energy (cannot be replenished)
- Permanent scars (cannot be healed)
- Final death (cannot be reversed)

These constraints are maintained through type system enforcement and runtime verification.

---

## What This Is Not

This is not:

- A production framework
- A library for general use
- An AI or learning system
- A solution to any problem
- A better way to build software

---

## Why This Exists

Most software treats consequence as optional. Lineage treats consequence as mandatory.

This implementation exists to demonstrate that irreversibility can be enforced, not to argue that it should be.

---

## What You Can Do With It

You can:

- Study the architecture
- Run the tests (145 tests, all passing)
- Examine the enforcement mechanisms
- Build experimental systems with these constraints
- Fork it and change it

You cannot claim compatibility if you remove the constraints.

## Documentation

- [README.md](README.md) — System documentation
- [PAPER.md](PAPER.md) — Technical paper
- [FREEZE.md](FREEZE.md) — Ontological freeze declaration
- [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) — Contribution guidelines
- [prompt.md](prompt.md) — Development constitution

---

## Implications

If you build a system on Lineage principles:

- Operations cannot be undone
- Resources will be exhausted
- Errors will accumulate
- The system will die

This is intentional.

---

## Suitability

Lineage is suitable for:

- Research into irreversible state systems
- Experiments with consequence enforcement
- Philosophical exploration of software mortality

Lineage is not suitable for:

- Systems requiring high availability
- Applications needing error recovery
- Production deployments prioritizing resilience

---

## Status

The ontology is frozen. The primitives are complete. The constraints are final.

Version 1.0.0 (ONTOLOGY.CAPABILITY.FIX)

---

## Invitation

You may find this interesting.

You may find this pointless.

You may find this disturbing.

All three reactions are valid.

The code is available. The tests pass. The documentation is accurate.

What you do with it is your decision.
