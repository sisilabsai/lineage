## 💡 Key Innovations

1. **Scars = Model Damage** 🔴
   - Every loss physically damages the neural network
   - Increases exploration to force recovery learning
   - Creates accountability in AI behavior

2. **Irreversible Evolution** 🧬
   - Trades are permanent (append-only ledger)
   - Every decision tracked cryptographically
   - Spawning creates verifiable lineage

3. **Cryptographic Accountability** 🔐
   - Trust scores tied to model performance
   - Scars leave permanent marks in history
   - Death removes underperforming lineages

4. **Real Market Integration** 📈
   - Live data from CoinMarketCap/CoinGecko
   - Epsilon-greedy exploration in flat markets
   - Adaptive strategies from real outcomes
